-- Initial Theme Setup Instructions --

Features list can be found in the LayoutStudio theme README.txt.

  1.  Download Layout Studio from http://drupal.org/project/layoutstudio
  
  2.  Unpack the downloaded file, take the entire layoutstudio folder
      and place it in your Drupal installation under one of the following 
      locations:
      
        - sites/all/themes: making it available to the default Drupal site and 
          to all Drupal sites in a multi-site configuration
        - sites/default/themes: making it available to only the default Drupal site
        - sites/mydomain.com/themes: making it available to only the example.com 
          site if there is a sites/yourdomain.com/settings.php configuration file
  
  3.  Make a copy of the MYTHEME folder in your themes folder. 

  4.  In the template.php, theme-settings.php and MYTHEME.info files, 
      replace all instances of MYTHEME with the name of your theme/project. 
      Make sure you use a lowercase name with no spaces (underscores are valid).
    
      For example, change all instances of "MYTHEME" to "my_client". 

  5.  Change the name of the theme folder to the same theme/project name.
    
      For example, rename MYTHEME folder to "my_client".

  6.  Rename "MYTHEME.info" to the name of your theme/project.
    
      For example, rename "MYTHEME.info" to"my_client.info".

  7.  Upload layoutstudio and your new theme folders to the remote server.

  8.  Enable your theme

  9.  Configure your theme

      Go to your theme's site configuration page for further options. Other than 
      the typical Drupal core options, you also have the following fields available:
     
        - Random class: requires a number higher than 1.
        - Choose default layout
        - Specify layout dimensions

  10. Get to work! Most CSS work is performed in the following stylesheets in your 
  		theme's CSS folder:
  			
  			- css/all.css (for all media types) - disabled by default
  			- css/screen.css (for screen or projection media types)
  			- css/print.css (for print media type) - disabled by default
  			- css/fonts/fonts.css (for adding @font-face fonts) - 
  			- css/mobile.css (for adding mobile specific layout settings) - 
  			  disabled by default


-- Extra Special Bits --

	1. Download and install the skinr module. You won't regret it
	2. Use .less css preprocessor files: MYTHEME/css/less
